    <p> <cite>The Maasai Mara Adventure</cite> by ABC</p>
    <blockquote>
        The breadth and diversity of lodging and activities offered in the Masai Mara National Reserve means that every kind of traveller is catered for. Solo travellers will find it easy to join up with group tours that run the gamut from budget-friendly camping trips to all-out luxury with all the special touches, adventurous travellers will be able to self-drive in the park and pitch their tents in a campsite, families will find child-friendly lodges with a host of kids’ activities, while travellers looking for a romantic holiday will be pampered at luxury camps that are well-geared for intimacy and romance, with private pools and decks, beautiful rooms and indulgent extras such as private champagne breakfasts for two in the bush.

However, even as we recognize that improving the welfare of free-ranging wild animals is difficult, we believe that humans have a responsibility to help whenever we can.</p>
